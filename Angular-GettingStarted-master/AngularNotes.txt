Typescript is the programming language for Angular applications
	Open source by Microsoft
	Superset of Javascript
		All typescript is valid javascript
	Transpiles to plain Javascript
	Strongly typed
		everything has a type
	Class-based object-orientation
	
Javascript language for the web (used by browsers)

To set the nuget package feed, use command
	npm configuration set registry https://url
	NOTE: I had to do this since tutorial npm install was pulling from the Alogent feed
	
================ MODULE 4 ================

Component
	Template
		View layout
		Html
		Bindings and directives
	Class
		Properties and methods (show hide logic)
		Code supporting view
		Typescript
		Naming convention is to do {ClassName}Component
		Root component is AppComponent
		'export' keyword makes it available for use in other components (uses component name)
		Body has
			Properties (camel case, strong typed, optional default value)
			Methods (camel case, verbs, actions, etc)
	Metadata 
		Extra data for Angular	
		Defined with decorator
		(template for class)
		To define component, use decorator
			Decorator is a function that adds metadata
				implemented in typescript
				limited to feature it decorates
				prefixed with @	- example @Component
				place immediately infront of feature, in this case above the class
			Compoment should always have a template - this is where you can define layout
	Importing
		'import' statement to use external functions or classes
		allows us to use exported members
			from angular framework
			other external JS libraries
	Bootstrapping
		for Angular Index.html contains
			script tags referencing the app files that are transpiled into javascript
			main page
			SPA
			looks in angular module to load components
